# pycrafter4500

This is an unofficial API for some functionality of the Texas Instruments Lightcrafter 4500. It is no longer maintained.

Code adapted for the TI Lightcrafter 4500 from https://github.com/csi-dcsc/Pycrafter6500

The DLPC 350 is the controller chip on the LCR 4500.

TI DLPC 350 documentation can be found at: http://www.ti.com/product/DLPC350/technicaldocuments
pycrafter4500 documentation can be found at: https://pycrafter4500.readthedocs.io/en/latest/moduledoc.html

Doc strings adapted from dlpc350_api.cpp source code.

To connect to the LCR4500, the libusb-win32 driver is required. The recommended way to do is this is
with [Zadig](http://zadig.akeo.ie/). The pyusb package is also required.


## Install

                           fps=222,
                           bit_depth=7,
                           led_color=0b111,  # BGR flags                 
                           )
```

If you wish to send other commands, this can be done using the dlpc350 class. See source documentation for further details.

```python
from pycrafter4500 import dlpc350, connect_usb
from pycrafter4500 import bits_to_bytes, conv_len

with connect_usb() as lcr:
    lcr.command('w', 0x00, CMD2, CMD3, payload)
